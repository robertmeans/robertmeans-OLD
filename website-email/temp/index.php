		<p>When I didn't hear back from you I inquired and learned from the kids that the way this was broached somehow left me as the bad guy. Could we please open the lines of communication in order to avoid stuff like this? My name really didn't even need to be brought into the conversation and the attitude that one of us can (or should) do all the parenting without the other is not in anyone's best interest and instead is hurting us all. I approached this as an opportunity for you and me to share in our daughter's life and provide practical information and/or assistance. She launched into my overreach into her personal business and the inescapable perils of the pill (as if these are certain universal constants). Engaging would have only exacerbated conflict so I had to surrender like some kind of inconsiderate interloper. Is this what you want?  Aside from the pill, did you discuss an IUD or any other option? I'm trying to work with you. Will you please meet me half way?</p>
