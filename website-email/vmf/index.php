		<p>I ran into a couple of girls (twenty-somethings) at the top of Bergen Peak the other day who kept me talking for about a half hour. They tried to convince me I was the coolest dad ever but I was hearing nothing of it! One of them was estranged from her dad and had been for 10 years. I explained how you were exploring your own path without me and she said that I need to let you know that I am always here for you and that I want to understand you. I think I try to convey the first part but then I assume the second part is implied or should be self-evident. Maybe this is just dad being clueless? I'm learning as I go and I don't have a woman around to explain to me when I'm blissfully off course. You've probably discovered by now - men are like bats. We "see" with a different set of sensory receptors that do not translate one-to-one across genders. We're blind in that sense. (On a positive note, I can hear colors.)</p>

		<p>All of this is just to let you know that if I don't say the right thing at the right time please know that I want to.</p>

		<p>I love you more than corn flakes.</p>
		<p>Love,<br/>
		Daddy-O!</p>
