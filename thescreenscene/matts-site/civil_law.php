<p class="bodyHeaderTxt">Civil Law</p>

<div class="longTextContent">

<p>Physical and emotional injuries can diminish or destroy your ability to work, rob you of the freedom to enjoy your life, and impact your family.</p>
<p>You may be entitled to money damages if your injuries are the result of the negligence of another. If the negligent party is insured, your chances of recovering money damages are increased. If the negligent party is uninsured, your insurance may be libel for the damages.</p>
<p>An insurance company is just that, a company. Most companies exist to make a profit. Paying you what you legally deserve decreases their profit.</p>
<p>Understanding this profit motive explains why some insurance companies will deny liability, offer to settle for less than you legally deserve, or simply ignore you. Insurance adjusters are skilled negotiators. They often use fear and intimidation to pressure you into a settlement. We believe it is always best to consult with a lawyer prior to accepting any offer.</p> 
<p>Our goal is to achieve justice for our clients. We work diligently to make insurance companies meet their legal obligations. If an insurance company does not offer a fair and just settlement, we will take the case to a trial by jury.</p>
