<div class="longTextContent">
<p>A criminal case can destroy your career, take away your freedom, and pull your family apart. The criminal justice system is based on the Puritanical ideals of punishment and revenge. The district attorney punishes people who are charged with crimes and seeks revenge for the victims of those crimes.</p> 
<p>When the district attorney sees your case they don't know who you are as a person. They see a police report, evidence, and charges. Explaining why or how things happened, who you are, or how the police got things wrong will not get your cases dismissed.</p>

<p>The judge ensures that the law is upheld and that your rights are not violated. Telling the judge what really happened or why you are not guilty will not get your case dismissed.</p> 

<p>Penalties for criminal offenses are often harsh. There are many situations where the judge has no control over the type of sentence you receive. Many convictions carry life long collateral consequences. You may be offered a plea bargain that includes jail or prison for a first offense.</p>

<p>The motivations of the district attorney, the role of the judge, and status of the law often result in a system that is unfair to an unrepresented person. Neither the judge nor the district attorney is there to advocate for you.</p>
